# PROJECT OVERVIEW
The main objective of this data analysis project is to analyze Ethereum  transaction data in order to identify patterns.
The question to be answered inlcude:
- How does Gas Price vary over time?
- Which Ethereum addresses are the most active?
- How many transaction are processed in specific period of time?
# INTRODUCTION

This report presents an analysis of Ethereum transaction patterns. The analysis focuses on three main aspects: variation of gas prices over time, activity of Ethereum addresses, and the number of transactions processed in a specific time period.

## Gas Prices Over Time
![Variation of Gas Price over Time](https://github.com/vincentakulinda/ON-CHAIN-DATA-ANALYSIS/assets/40827558/45817848-6892-4b92-b86b-178820aa1be4)

The first part of the analysis involved examining how gas prices vary over time. The line chart represents the fluctuation of gas prices from 2016 to 2023. The x-axis represents time in days, and the y-axis represents the gas price. The lineâ€™s peaks and valleys indicate increases and decreases in gas prices, respectively.

**Findings**: The gas price has been fluctuating over the years, with a noticeable peak in 2021. This suggests that gas prices in the Ethereum network are volatile and can change significantly over time.
## Most Active Ethereum Addresses

The next part of the analysis focused on identifying the most active Ethereum addresses. The bar chart represents the number of unique sender addresses active in transactions over time. The x-axis represents the sender addresses, and the y-axis represents the number of active addresses. Each bar represents the number of unique sender addresses active in transactions at a specific point in time.
**Findings**: There is a significant increase in the number of active sender addresses from the first to the last data point. This suggests an increase in the number of unique addresses initiating transactions over this period.

## Number of Transactions Over Time

The final part of the analysis looked at the number of transactions processed in a specific time period. The bar chart represents the number of transactions from unique addresses over time. The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents the number of transactions. Each bar represents the number of transactions from unique addresses at a specific point in time.

**Findings**: There was a significant increase in the number of transactions in 2020, indicating a surge in activity on the Ethereum network during this period. The lowest number of transactions occurred in 2015 and 2022, suggesting less activity during these years.

# Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into Ethereum transaction patterns. Understanding these patterns can help in making informed decisions in various applications, such as trading, mining, and developing decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum platform.

# Recommendations
Based on the findings of this analysis, it is recommended:

1. For those participating in the Ethereum network, such as traders or developers, itâ€™s important to monitor gas prices regularly as they can impact transaction costs. High gas prices can make transactions more expensive, while low gas prices can make them cheaper. Therefore, understanding gas price trends can help in planning transactions and managing costs effectively. ðŸ˜Š
2. This increase in active sender addresses could indicate a growing user base or increased activity on the Ethereum network. It would be beneficial to investigate the cause of this increase. Understanding the factors driving this growth can provide insights for strategic planning, such as anticipating network congestion periods or identifying opportunities for investment or development in the Ethereum ecosystem. ðŸ˜Š
3. Understanding the pattern of transactions over time can help identify periods of high activity on the Ethereum network, which could be linked to various factors such as market trends, changes in gas prices, or the launch of popular DApps. Further investigation could be done to understand what caused the increase in 2020 and see if similar conditions can be replicated or anticipated in future years for strategic planning. ðŸ˜Š
